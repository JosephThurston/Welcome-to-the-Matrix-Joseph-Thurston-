	<h1> Why I Decided to Leave the UK to do a Master's in France </h1>
	<h2> Two years of Industry Experience </h1>


	<p>
		One of the main benefits of doing a work-study Master’s in France is the fact that it allows students to obtain two whole years of industry experience. This experience is not only advantageous, but for some jobs, even essential: I’ve come across plenty of entry-level positions in France that require candidates to have ‘2+ years of experience’. Oftentimes, if you show that you’re indispensable to the team and bring a handful of doughnuts to work now and then, companies that hired you as an <em> alternant </em> throughout your Master’s will even offer you a full-time position after graduation. Since students are alternating between classes and work, they consistently get to apply new knowledge from university to their workplace, making for a dynamic learning experience.
